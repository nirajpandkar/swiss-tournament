## API

### tournament.registerPlayer(name)

> Adds a player to the tournament database.
  
The database assigns a unique serial id number for the player.  (This
should be handled by your SQL database schema, not in your Python code.)

**Args**:
  name: the player's full name (need not be unique).
  
### tournament.countPlayers()

> Returns the number of players currently registered.

### tournament.deletePlayers()

> Remove all the player records from the database.

### tournament.deleteMatches()

> Remove all the match records from the database.

### tournament.playerStandings()

> Returns a list of the players and their win records, sorted by wins.

The first entry in the list should be the player in first place, 
or a player tied for first place if there is currently a tie.

**Returns**:
  A list of tuples, each of which contains (id, name, wins, matches):
    _id_: the player's unique id (assigned by the database)
    _name_: the player's full name (as registered)
    _wins_: the number of matches the player has won
    _matches_: the number of matches the player has played
    
### tournament.reportMatch(winner, loser)

> Records the outcome of a single match between two players.

**Args**:
      _winner_:  the id number of the player who won
      _loser_:  the id number of the player who lost
      
### tournament.swissPairings()

> Returns a list of pairs of players for the next round of a match.

Each player is paired with another
player with an equal or nearly-equal win record, that is, a player 
adjacent to him or her in the standings.
  
**Returns**:
  A list of tuples, each of which contains (id1, name1, id2, name2)
    _id1_: the first player's unique id
    _name1_: the first player's name
    _id2_: the second player's unique id
    _name2_: the second player's name
